    <h6>PHIPPS - Lord Goring’s Servant</h6>
        <p><br>LORD GORING.  Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
            presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p>br>
        <br>LORD CAVERSHAM.  No, sir; I have called this evening for a definite
        purpose, and I am going to see it through at all costs to my health or
        yours.  Put down my cloak, sir.
        
        LORD GORING.  Certainly, father.  But let us go into another room.
        [_Rings bell_.]  There is a dreadful draught here.  [_Enter_ PHIPPS.]
        Phipps, is there a good fire in the smoking-room?
        
        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.</br>
    <br>MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a look of surprise_.]  Lord Goring expects me?

    PHIPPS.  Yes, madam.
    
    MRS. CHEVELEY.  Are you quite sure?</br>
<br>
PHIPPS.  The lady is in that room, my lord.  You told me to show her into
that room, my lord</br>
<br>[_Enter_ PHIPPS _with drinks_.]

PHIPPS.  [_Hands hock and seltzer to_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  Hock and
seltzer, sir.</br>
<br>Phipps_  _the butler_, _is arranging
some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
the dominance of form_.</br>
<br>
LORD GORING.  Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?

PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</br>
<br>LORD GORING.  To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
Phipps.

PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.</br>
<br>LORD GORING.  [_Turns round and looks at him_.  PHIPPS _remains
impassive_.]  Hum!  Any letters, Phipps?

PHIPPS.  Three, my lord.  [_Hands letters on a salver_.]</br>
<br>LORD GORING.  Certainly, father.  But let us go into another room.
[_Rings bell_.]  There is a dreadful draught here.  [_Enter_ PHIPPS.]
Phipps, is there a good fire in the smoking-room?

PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.</br></p>
