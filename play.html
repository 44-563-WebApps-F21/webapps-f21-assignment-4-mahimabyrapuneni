        <h5>ACT II.  _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_.</h5>
            <p class=stage-direction>Enter LADY CHILTERN, MRS. MARCHMONT, and LADY BASILDON</p>

            <h6 class="name MRS. MARCHMONT"> MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?
            </p>

            <p class=stage-direction>LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">I suppose so.  Are you? </p>

            <p class="stage-direction">MRS. MARCHMONT</p>

            <p class="speech">Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>
            

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
                go anywhere.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">MRS. MARCHMONT</p>

            <p class="speech">I come here to be educated.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">MRS. MARCHMONT</p>

            <p class="speech">So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
                commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
                telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
                here to try to find one.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
                anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
                The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
                time.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">MRS. MARCHMONT</p>

            <p class="speech">How very trivial of him!</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?.</p>
