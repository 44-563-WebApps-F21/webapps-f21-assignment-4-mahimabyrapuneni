        <h5>ACT II.  _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_.</h5>
            <p class=stage-direction>Enter LADY CHILTERN, MRS. MARCHMONT, and LADY BASILDON</p>

            <h6 class="name MRS. MARCHMONT"> MRS. MARCHMONT</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?
            </p>

            <p class=stage-direction>LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">I suppose so.  Are you? </p>

            <p class="stage-direction">MRS. MARCHMONT</p>

            <p class="speech">Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>
            

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
                go anywhere.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">MRS. MARCHMONT</p>

            <p class="speech">I come here to be educated.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">MRS. MARCHMONT</p>

            <p class="speech">So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
                commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
                telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
                here to try to find one.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
                anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
                The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
                time.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">MRS. MARCHMONT</p>

            <p class="speech">How very trivial of him!</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">LADY BASILDON</p>

            <p class="speech">Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?.</p>

            <h6 class="name LORD CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
            <p class="speech"> [_Languidly_.]  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Has my good-for-nothing
                young son been here?</p>

            <h6 class="name LADY CHILTERN">LADY CHILTERN</h6>
            <p class="speech">[_Smiling_.]  I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.</p>

            <h6 class="name MABEL CHILTERN">MABEL CHILTERN</h6>
            <p class="speech">[_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  Why do you call Lord
                Goring good-for-nothing?</p>

            <h6 class="name LORD CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Because he leads such an idle life.</p>

            <h6 class="name MABEL CHILTERN">MABEL CHILTERN</h6>
            <p class="speech">How can you say such a thing?  Why, he rides in the Row
                at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week,
                changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night
                of the season.  You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?</p>

            <h6 class="name LORD CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6>
            <p class="speech">[_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.]
                You are a very charming young lady!</p>
              

                <p class="stage-direction">VICOMTE DE NANJAC and MRS. CHEVELEY</p>

                <h6 class="name VICOMTE DE NANJAC">VICOMTE DE NANJAC</h6>
                <p class="speech">Not since Berlin, Vicomte.  Five years ago!</p>
    
                <h6 class="name MRS. CHEVELEY">MRS. CHEVELEY</h6>
                <p class="speech">And you are younger and more beautiful than ever.
                    How do you manage it?</p>
    
                <p class="stage-direction">enternace of SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</p>
    
                <p class="speech">Good evening, Lady Markby!  I hope you have brought
                    Sir John with you?</p>
    
                <p class="stage-direction">Re-enter LADY MARKBY</p>
    
                <p class="speech">Oh! I have brought a much more charming person than Sir
                    John.  Sir John’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has
                    become quite unbearable.  Really, now that the House of Commons is trying
                    to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.</p>
