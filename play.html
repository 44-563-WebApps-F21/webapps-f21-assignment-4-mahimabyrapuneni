    <h3>LADY CHILTERN</h3>
    <h6>LADY CHILTERN -Miss Julia Neilson_.</h6>
<p><br>LADY CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.</br>
<br>LADY CHILTERN.  We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.</br>
<br>LADY CHILTERN.  There must be some mistake.  That scheme could never have
my husband’s support.</br>
<br>LADY CHILTERN.  Good-night, dear!  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  You saw whom Lady
Markby brought here to-night?</br>
<br>LADY CHILTERN.  But you told me yesterday that you had received the
report from the Commission, and that it entirely condemned the whole
thing.</br>
<br>LADY CHILTERN.  What?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That it was necessary, vitally necessary?</br>
<br>[LADY CHILTERN.  Well?
LORD GORING.  He walks in the mire.  Of course I am only talking
generally about life.</br>
<br>LLADY CHILTERN.  But I like you to be serious.</br>
<br>LADY CHILTERN.  What has poor Mr. Trafford done this time?  Robert says
he is the best secretary he has ever had.</br></p>
